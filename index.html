  <h1><P style=text-align:center>Grand Theft Auto</P></h1>
  <p>Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can 
    complete missions to progress an overall story, as well 
    as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay
     revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional 
     role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements
      of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games 
      in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled 
      after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 
      1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed 
      three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas 
      (based on San Francisco), and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles 
      tend to focus on a single setting; usually one of the original three locales, 
      albeit remodelled and significantly expanded. The series centers on different 
      protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, 
      although their motives for doing so vary in each title. 
      The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed
       the protagonist or their organisation, or characters who have 
       the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. 
       Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, 
       including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner,
        James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.
